# Market_GPT

## Overview
Welcome to Market_GPT, a groundbreaking project aimed at developing a finance-focused AI Q&A system. Leveraging open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and a diverse range of market data, our mission is to provide nuanced and accurate financial analysis. This initiative is perfect for enthusiasts and professionals interested in financial markets, AI, data science, and machine learning.

## Project Status
**Current Phase:** Data Gathering

Our primary focus at present is to amass a comprehensive knowledge base for AI model training. By integrating advanced LLMs with extensive financial datasets, we aim to create a system that delivers in-depth financial insights.

## Data Sources
We are compiling a varied set of financial data, including:

- **Historical Price Data:** Utilizing a Yahoo Finance scraper inspired by [this Kaggle project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jacksoncrow/download-nasdaq-historical-data), we are collecting historical prices for all securities listed in the US market.

- **High-Frequency Data:** Historic second-by-second data acquired from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org) enriches our database with detailed financial metrics.

- **Key Financial Indicators:** Our dataset includes diverse indicators such as mortgage rates, bond yields, GDP, M1 and M2 money supply levels, major index values, inflation figures, CPI data, home sales, credit card delinquency rates, and unemployment data.

## Libraries and Technologies Explored
In the course of our project, we have explored various libraries and technologies, including but not limited to:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `yfinance`: For downloading historical market data from Yahoo Finance.
- `os` and `contextlib`: For managing file paths and streamlining file handling operations.
- `shutil`: For high-level file operations.
- Additional data analysis and AI libraries as our project progresses.
